# Personal-Assistant
Hello This text-to-speech project is my first group project. By transforming written text into spoken audio, a text-to-speech (TTS) project can create a variety of applications. My coworker and I are using C++ and Espeak in this project. Numerous instructions are executed by this project, including greeting the user, displaying the time and date, opening a webpage from another website, creating a random number, and computing various numbers. Using a text command, it may also be used to open Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Notepad.Additionally, it may be used to find the IP address of any location, restart, shut down, or fall asleep the laptop.
Due to the usage of third-party text-to-speech software, it is difficult to regulate our assistant's speech output, and the assistant is not currently able to handle vocal inputs or orders.
